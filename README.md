Advanced Excel formulas

Dashboard Design

Tasks Performed

Conditional Formatting
Applied conditional formatting to highlight the top 10 customers based on total purchase value.

Used summary data to visually identify high-value customers.

WHAT-IF Analysis (Impact of Discount on Profit)
Used Scenario Manager to analyze profit changes under different discount levels.

Created scenarios such as No Discount, Moderate Discount, and High Discount.

Generated a Scenario Summary for comparison.

Linear Regression Analysis
Performed linear regression using the Data Analysis Toolpak.

Analyzed the relationship between Sales (independent variable) and Profit (dependent variable).

Interpreted regression coefficients and R-square value.

Descriptive Statistics
Generated descriptive statistics for key variables such as Sales and Profit.

Calculated mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values.

Used results for advanced descriptive analytics.

Monthly Sales Growth with Arrows
Calculated month-wise sales growth.

Applied custom conditional formatting with up/down arrows to indicate growth trends.

Timestamp Creation
Added a timestamp column using the NOW() function.

Used to track the last updated time of analysis.

High-Value Customer Identification
Identified high-value customers using:

INDEX

MATCH

FILTER

Combined total sales data to extract customers contributing maximum revenue.

Pivot Table Analysis
Created pivot tables to analyze:

Total sales by region

Total sales by product category

Used pivot tables as a base for charts and dashboard visuals.

Data Visualization
Created the following charts:

Bar Chart for regional sales comparison

Line Chart for monthly sales trend

Pie Chart for product category contribution

Visualized key performance indicators effectively.

Dashboard and Data Storytelling
Designed an interactive dashboard summarizing:

Total Sales

Total Profit

Top Customers

Sales Trends

Presented insights using charts and pivot tables.

Provided data-driven business interpretations.

Insights and Observations

A small group of customers contributes significantly to total revenue.

Higher discounts negatively impact profit beyond a threshold.

Sales and profit show a positive linear relationship.

Certain regions and product categories outperform others consistently.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of advanced Excel features for data analysis, visualization, and business insight generation. The Analyzer project integrates analytical tools, formulas, and dashboards to support informed decision-making through data storytelling.
